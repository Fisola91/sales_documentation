## Project aim
Sales documentation aims to empower small enterprises with efficient tools to manage and grow their businesses effortlessly. We understand the challenges faced by market women in keeping track of their sales, and gaining insights to make informed business decisions. That is why a user-friendly app is developed, tailored specifically to meet their needs. With the app, market women can say goodbye to the hassle of manual paperwork and embrace a more efficient way of managing their sales.
